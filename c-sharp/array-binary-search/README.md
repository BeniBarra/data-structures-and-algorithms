## array-binary-search
Create a meathod that takes in an array and a search key. <br>
Return the value within the search key that matches the value

## Whiteboard Process
- Created by Miriam Silva, Joel Connell, & Benjamin Ibarra
- We detailed a `problem domain` specifying the requirements of the challenge
- Then Made a `Visual` representation of the array value swapping
- Roughed out the steps for our `algorithm`
- Wrote out `Pseudo code` detailing in plain-ish english our codes intended structure and behavior
- Outlined steps to `verify` our solution and test possible edge cases

## Approach & Efficiency
- Given array and search key
- Loop through the array
- if statment to match element to search key
- return matching element
