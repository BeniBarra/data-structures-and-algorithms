# Hash Tables
New implementation

Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

- add
    - Arguments: key, value
    - Returns: nothing
    -This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- get
    - Arguments: key
    - Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
- contains
    - Arguments: key
    - Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- hash
    - Arguments: key
    - Returns: Index in the collection for that key


# Tests
Tested for proper hash capability, null response from empty hashtable, get function, contains function, and null responses from both get and contains
