# Graphs
Benjamin Ibarra

## Implementation
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:  

- add node
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: The added node
    - Add a node to the graph
- add edge
    - Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
    - Returns: nothing
    - Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
    -  If specified, assign a weight to the edge
    - Both nodes should already be in the Graph
- get nodes
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
- get neighbors
    - Arguments: node
    - Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
    - Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection


## Tests
- Tested graph ability
- Tested edge creation
- Tested single vertex graphing
- Tested Null catch in node retrival
- Test GetNode()
