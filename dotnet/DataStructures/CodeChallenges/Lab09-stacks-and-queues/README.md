# Stacks & Queues
First exercise with Stacks and Queues  
implementing of all required methodes to manipulate either stack or queue  
Stack Methods:  
`Push()`  
`Pop()`  
`Peek()`  
`IsEmpty()`  

Queue Methods:  
`Enqueue()`  
`Dequeue()`  
`Peek()`  
`IsEmpty()`  

## Challenge
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency
Implemented commonly used methods when creating and controlling Stacks and Queues with O(1) time performance
